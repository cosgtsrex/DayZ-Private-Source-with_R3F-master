    - problem with addrating -10000 = enemy to everyone
    - need to look into if its possible to add a trigger to the cars to remove the rating if ppl are close to cars
    - would mean that bandit helis and cars never get shot by AI
    - switch sides of bandits while in a car ?

    - 2 triggers to handle distance warning & actual noshoot zone
    - defended by AI that can not be damaged
